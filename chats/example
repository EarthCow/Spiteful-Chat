chats are going to be encypted
or denied permissions
or moved outside of the www folder
given a unique name stored in db

syntx will be mutated as follows

;123:Earth#129482"Hello, how are you?"

the semicolon (;) indicates the start of a new message

123: indicates the id of the specific message

the Earth#129482 will be the username and the unique number identifying the specific user

for the function of replying to a specific message

deciding whether or not to scrap this idea and simply use json files and techniques instead.

{
  0: {
    "from":"Earth#129482",
    "reply":false,
    "content":"you stupid motherfucker"
    "timestamp":129094231
  }
}

; indicates start of message
0 is the message id

4 indicates the id of the profile who sent the message
: indicates a seperation of the message data (i.e. moving from id to actually message content)
"" this is going to be the actual message which will be base64 encoded to ensure there are no ; or : within the field
: sperates again
0 | 1 will be a true or false as to if this is a reply to another message (need to decide how to do this) -- could possibly instead of 1 or 0 it could be false or the id of the message that it is responding to
129094231 the timestamp the message was sent at

;0:4:"base64 encoded message":0:129094231

idk

New idea/info --------

column chats in db will store json as such

{
  d7s7ds89s4s868f56s448786s: {
    encryptionKey: kdjafkdh776a576a5d7f6567a5f675a76s5fas67ew5,
    recipient: 2,
    recipientImage: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ALm5wu3y5-RheCwpL46nR7nAgDlLTKRtyv2AIMnqL2QL=s96-c",
    lastMessage: "I like boobs",
    lastModified: "10/10/2022 21:36:27"
  }
}

the initial identifier is indicating the name the chat file is stored at in this directory.

the encryptionKey will be used to decrypt the encypted chat file
recipient is the id of the opposite person in the chat
image is there pfp
last message is the most recent message
last lastModified is the last time anyone sent anything
